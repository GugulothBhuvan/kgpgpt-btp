    "Most software companies have a online coding test usually held in CIC or Nalanda (with own laptops) for shortlisting of candidates for the interview process. This test has short programming questions and at times knowledge questions on programming languages. Most common questions on programming languages are on C,C++ or Java.  After you qualify the coding test, you get shortlisted for the interview, usually for all the SDE positions. The general process consists of 2-3 technical rounds followed by 1 HR round. Some companies (Usually Microsoft) has a Group Discussion Round too to shortlist where they give a design question of a system where everyone is asked to collaborate and discuss on how to design the specified system as Company employees judge on how much a candidate contributes. In the technical rounds, they ask 2-3 coding questions which you have to code on paper(proper syntax and everything, not pseudo code) and/or domain related questions from DBMS, Networks, OS and ML(if mentioned in the resume). The biggest focus is on whether you can find an optimal algorithm to solve the given problem/ implementation, and then code it in a reasonable amount of time.",

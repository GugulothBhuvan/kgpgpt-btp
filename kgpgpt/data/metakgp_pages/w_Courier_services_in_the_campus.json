    "DTDC - Moving and Large Goods : Situated next to Amul Ice Cream shop opposite the gate to Jnan Ghosh Stadium. This shop doesn't have a proper board and can be hard to locate, ask the people around for help. This is particularly useful when you are graduating from college and want to ship your over-sized bags / cartons of books or clothes back home. The rates are reasonable (~Rs. 25 per kg) and the staff are very helpful with packing. They will safely pack your suitcase / carton and ship it. Average time for reaching the destination is about 10 days for metro cities, and 15-20 days for towns and villages. Items are shipped on trucks.",

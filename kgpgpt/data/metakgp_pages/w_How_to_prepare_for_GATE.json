    "The Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) is an all- India examination that primarily tests the comprehensive understanding of various undergraduate subjects in engineering and science. The score is used for admissions to various post-graduate education programs (e.g. Master of Engineering, Master of Technology, Doctor of Philosophy) in Indian higher education institutes, with financial assistance provided by MHRD and other government agencies.",

    "A long list. It’s better to check this from host institute’s GATE website.",
    "It depends on how serious a student has been throughout the courses that he/she has been taught during the regular coursework. Given the worst case scenario, it will still not take more than 2 months to go through all the required concepts. Considering the syllabus, GATE (Biotechnology) paper can be divided as follows:",
    "Difficulty level -> Average",
    "This is the easiest portion of the exam, need not waste much time on this to prepare but ensure you get it all right in exam. Solve as much question as possible from previous year GATE question papers or sample papers available. Basic level questions from Mathematics – 1 & 2 (1 st year) will be asked.",
    "A good amount of quantitative questions will be asked from Bioprocess engineering, Analytical biotechnology, Enzymes biotechnology and Classical Genetics combined with simple probability concepts. One needs to be thorough with the concepts (which are actually very few) from above topics and a bit of practice leads to a very good score in this section. Good score in this section makes a big difference to the overall score obtained since generally biotechnology students lack mathematics background at intermediate level.",
    "Some questions are set to test the inference skills of students. These questions may or may not require the background knowledge of the domain they belong to but require critical analysis of the situation in the problem. These question can be compared to Logical Reasoning section of other standard aptitude tests.",
    "There are some questions in paper which test the amount of literature one has consumed. There isn’t any specific strategy for such types of questions, the best advice is just to keep revising the topics under syllabus as much as possible from different sources.",

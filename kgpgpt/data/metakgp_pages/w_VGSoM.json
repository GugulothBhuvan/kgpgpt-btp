    "Vinod Gupta School of Management (VGSoM) was set up as the first school of management within the IIT system in 1993, with the help of a distinguished alumnus & a life time Fellow of the Institute, Mr. Vinod Gupta (B. Tech. 1967), the former CEO and Chairman of InfoGROUP (previously known as InfoUSA) whose generous endowment of 2 Million US Dollars was matched by liberal support from the Government of India. The mission of the school is to develop outstanding management professionals capable of playing leadership roles in their chosen careers in organisations in different sectors of the economy, especially in technology-driven and knowledge based industries that are characterized by high degrees of globalisation, dynamism, complexity and innovativeness. The school offers a Doctoral programme in management (PhD) and an MBA programme for working executives over weekends in Kolkata and Bhubaneswar. The school also regularly organizes guest lectures, Mangement Development Programmes (MDPs) and training programs for educators in India and abroad. The school also offers a unique need-based scholarship to its students with the sole aim to ensure access of deserving students to world class management training.

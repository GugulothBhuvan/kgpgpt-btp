    "The hall has been divided in 3 blocks namely A, B, and C. Each of the blocks has 2 floors above the ground floor. There is a common room for television, just near the entrance. There is also a common room for indoor sports which include a Table Tennis Table and Carom-board.",
    "In the academic year 2023-24, Gokhale Hall accommodates around 150 students. According to the HMC's website, this hall has 10 single-accommodation rooms and 44 triple-sharing rooms. [ 1 ] The triple-sharing rooms are quite cramped and not very well ventilated (it appears that they were originally built to accommodate two people), but have attached toilets and rooms to wash clothes by hands. Each floor also has two common toilets and a washing-machine, as well as water coolers.",

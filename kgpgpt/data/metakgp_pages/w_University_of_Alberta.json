    "University of Alberta is located in Edmonton, capital of Alberta, Canada. UAlberta's main campus is located in the centre of Edmonton, just minutes from downtown and surrounded by the beautiful river valley. With a major transit station on campus, there is easy access to the city’s many attractions. During the internship, opportunities to participate in cultural and social events such as city festivals or day trips to nearby attractions are offered on a weekly basis. A trip to the Rocky Mountains is made available to every intern.",
    "Interns are responsible for their own housing. A few students stay in the Lister Centre, but most interns stay in subleased apartments, which are cheaper and available on campus or right outside campus. Since housing is cheaper outside campus, a number of students opt to stay far from the campus and take a convenient 10-15 minute ride to the campus in the LRT. Subleases can be easily found by visiting facebook pages listing sublease ads. Facebook groups formed by the scholars also turn out to be extremely useful sources of information.",
    "The application process for Canadian work permit visa is smooth. The application process is clearly listed on the Canadian immigration and travel website. Ideally, the VISA is delivered to you within 2 weeks of applying. However, the processing time of a work permit visa is known to vary between 20 days and 2 months. Hence, it is in your best interest to apply as soon as you receive the award letter and all the supporting documents.",

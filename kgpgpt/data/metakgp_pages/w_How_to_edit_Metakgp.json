    "User pages: You have your own page on this wiki – check it out ! You can add information about yourself, or anything else you want, on this page.

    "Upload a new image to MediaWiki commons. Make sure you have the rights to this image – either it should be yours, or you need to have permission from the owner.",

    "Sometimes the Visual Editor doesn't have the full set of features that wiki markup offers. In those rare cases, click on Edit source , and take a look at the excellent and short Wikipedia editing tutorial . If you still face problems, don't hesitate to contact any of the admins . Some pages, like this one, don't have Visual Editor enabled, and you must edit the source.",
    "Formatting",
    "Metakgp is a community driven wiki. KGPians are the editors of Metakgp, and no official organisation or student body controls it. The most active editors generally end up having the largest say in the wiki's policies. To understand why we think this wiki is a good idea, check out Amrav: Why metakgp?"

    "The department was set up in 1965 leading to B.Tech (Hons.) degree after a high power committee appointed by GOI stressed the need for manpower training in the field of Aeronautical Engineering. Over the years, the department has built up laboratories in the areas of aerodynamics, structures and propulsion. A Centre of Excellence for Composite Structures Technology, funded by ARDB, has been established in 1999. Some major thrust areas of the future are Aerospace Control Systems, Aero-Servo-Elasticity, Aerothermo-Mechanics, Industrial Aerodynamics, Air Breathing Propulsion, Composites, Computational Fluid Dynamics, Non-destructive testing and Wind Energy. Currently, the research efforts of the faculty are supported by a large number of projects sponsored by ARDB, ADA, ISRO, DST, AICTE, MHRD and many other organisations",

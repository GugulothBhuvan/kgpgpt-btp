    "The GNOME Foundation then resumed the effort in 2010 with fact rounds organized every half a year. In the May-August 2012 round, the Software Freedom Conservancy joined the Outreach Program for Women with one internship with the Twisted project. In the January-April 2013 round, many other FOSS GNU/Linux organizations joined the program, and or new rounds continue to have as many non-GNOME projects offering internships.",

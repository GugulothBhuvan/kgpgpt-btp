    "Students obtaining passports during their stay in IIT Kharagpur usually submit their hall documentation as a proof of current address. As a part of appointment and credential verification the applicants are required to visit the Passport Seva Kendra (PSK) at Kharagpur Technology Mukhya Dakghar (Kharagpur Technology Sub Post Office) which is right inside the IIT Campus.",
    "For the required documents you need to carry with you, visit this website: Document Advisor",
    "Visit the post office in the IIT Campus, near the SBI Bank near Puri Gate: Kharagpur Technology Sub Post Office",
    "The person-in-charge at the station might ask for additional cash reimbursements for processing your application. The amount demanded varies. It is up to the applicant to decide whether to comply with the request or deny. In past, people who have denied any payments have also received passports without any issues. If your papers are in order, you will get your passport, irrespective of whether you pay this guy or not.",
    "Recently police will visit campus and call you if you have selected Kharagpur Town or campus police will contact you if you have chosen Kharagpur local as jurisdiction while filling the application"

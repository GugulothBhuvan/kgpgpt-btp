    "This event was judged by two professors among, among whom Prof. M. K. Panigrahi of the Department of Geology and Geophysics was one. The motion for the debate was The media has done more harm than good to the society . The speakers arguing for the motion stressed on how the media today drowns the masses in irrelevance and misinformation. The advent of the 24x7 media bodies have embraced sensationalism to stay ahead of their competitors and this hurts the society very dearly. Major arguments against the motion were that the media, however sensationalist and irritating, serves as a very important check to government power in almost all modern democracies. Also, the cumulative impact the media has had, from the press of the French revolution to social media outrage in the Jasmine revolution is unparalleled.",

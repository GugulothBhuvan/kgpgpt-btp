    "Maggu Room , or F127 is a classroom in the main building that remains open 24*7. It is a well sought destination to study together and work on group projects. On regular days, the hour of rush is from 11:30-12:30 when the Central Library starts getting vacated and the crowd pours into Maggu Room. However, during the exam season, students tend to prefer the air-conditioned library that remains open all night. By day, Maggu room is a regular classroom holding classes such as Partial Differential Equations and Basic Economics. [ 1 ] The Career Development Centre also uses the Maggu Room during Phase 2 internship/placement seasons.",

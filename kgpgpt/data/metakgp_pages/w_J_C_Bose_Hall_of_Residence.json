    "Acharya J. C. Bose Hall of Residence was established in 1962. This Hall was named after Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose , a polymath, a physicist, biologist, botanist, archaeologist, and writer of science fiction. He pioneered the investigation of radio and microwave optics, made very significant contributions to plant science, and laid the foundations of experimental science in the Indian sub-continent. He was the first from the Indian Sub-continent to be granted an US patent, in 1904. He is known for his research of remote wireless signaling and the use of semiconductor junctions to detect radio signals for the first time.\nIt has been a post-graduate students' hall till 2015. In 2015, eleven under-graduate students were allotted this hall for the first time.",
    "The hall has been divided in 6 blocks namely A, B, C East, C West, E and F block. Each of the blocks has one floor above the ground floor. There is a common room for television, just near the entrance. Then comes a common room for indoor sports which include a Snookers table, Table Tennis Table and Carom-board. There are two more entrance to the hall apart from the main gate at the back behind the mess.

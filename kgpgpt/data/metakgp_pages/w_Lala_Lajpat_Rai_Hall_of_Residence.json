    "The hall was founded on March 18, 1967, and the name was given in honour of the great freedom fighter and leader of Indian Independence Movement, Lala Lajpat Rai .",
    "The hall has been divided into 4 blocks namely A1, A, B and C. Each of the blocks has two floors above the ground floor. There are 24 wings in the hall (6 in A1 and A blocks & 18 in B and C blocks). The mess and common room are adjacent to the A block and are near the entrance gate. There is one more entrance to the hall apart from the main gate, which is mostly locked and is opened in special occasions. It opens right in the cycle shed of the hall. There was a shed in the back side of the hall which was called as \"D-block\" but then it was run over by a wall due to some reasons.",

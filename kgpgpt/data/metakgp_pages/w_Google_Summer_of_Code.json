    "The Google Summer of Code ( GSoC ) is an international online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development . GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a programming project under the guidance of mentors. Stipends of upto US$3,000 (as of 2023) are awarded to students who successfully complete a proposed free and open-source software development project during the summer. Google has introduced multiple sized projects ( 90 , 175 and 350 hours). As of 2024 the standard project length for small ( 90 hour) projects is 8 weeks , while medium ( 175 hour) and large ( 350 hour) projects are 12 weeks by default",

    "The event draws its name from the 1967 Summer of Love (of the 1960s Counterculture ), and the idea for the SoC came directly from Google's founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page . [ 1 ] From 2007 until 2009 Leslie Hawthorn, who has been involved in the project since 2006, was the program manager. [ 2 ] In 2010, Carol Smith took over management of the program. [ 3 ]",
    "During the the period of 2005-2012 IIT Kharagpur had produced the highest number (51) of GSoCers from India [ 4 ] , and by 2016 there have been 92 GSoCers from IIT Kharagpur [ 5 ] .  But as of now, IIIT Hyderabad holds the record for producing maximum number of GSoC students from India. [ 6 ]",
    "To apply in Google Summer of Code, students need to write an application proposal to their respective mentoring organisations. Often mentoring organisations have their own application templates which typically asks the student to give biographical information, details of the project and a timeline. The application window typically opens up in March for a period of eleven days but it is recommended that students start working on their applications as soon as the list of participating organisations is announced.",
    "To participate in GSoC one needs to be a student and should be more than 18 years old before the results are announced. There is no other requirement of department or year of study. [ 7 ] Also, you cannot participate in Google Summer of Code for more than two times. This criteria is in application since 2017 edition.",
    "Post 2021, even non-university students can participate in GsoC.",
    "Until 2016, Google paid a total amount of US $5,500 in three batches. The initial amount of US $500 was paid at the end of the community bonding period, the second instalment of US $2,250 at the end of the mid-term evaluation, and the remaining amount at the end of the final-term evaluation. However, from 2017, Stipends are adjusted based on country ($2,400 for India) and are paid in three parts, one after each successful evaluation. [ 8 ] . This was later changed to 3000# for India in 2019 edition.",
    "First Evaluation (paid Late June / early July): 30%",
    "Second Evaluation (paid Late July / early August): 30%",
    "Final Evaluation (paid September): 40%",
    "Google offers payment through Payoneer in two modes, but for Indian students only direct deposit option is available. No money is given should one fail the evaluations, miss the deadlines or withdraw from the program.",
    "As of 2024, Indian students get a stipend of $750 (for small sized projects), $1500 (for medium sized projects) or $3000 (for large sized projects) in two stages:",
    "Mid Evaluation: (Mid July) - 45%",
    "End Evaluation (Early September) - 55%",
    "FLOSS Manuals has a detailed manual about Google Summer of Code which includes sample student proposals. Python Software Foundation's FAQs on GSoC are also pretty informative.",

    "The Kharagpur Winter of Code , often abbreviated as KWoC , is an annual five week long program where students new or unknown to free and open-source software contribute to coding projects registered in the program by experienced mentors or project owners and gain experience in contributing to open source software. The program is hosted by Kharagpur Open Source Society, an independent student group at IIT Kharagpur , but is open to students of any university.",
    "The motive of organizing the program is to help students have one-on-one mentorship in the early phase of contributing to open source software. This also helps the students, especially freshmen and sophomores in their preparation for Google Summer of Code which takes place annually in March.",
    "Kharagpur Winter of Code has been online since its inception and operates on its website https://kwoc.kossiitkgp.org",

    "The program invites mentors who have ownership or collaborative rights on open source software projects, to register the projects. In the last week of November, the list of accepted projects is released on the website and students begin signing up for the program. Students then start to look through the projects and choose one or more of their choice.",
    "Coding period for KWoC begins in the first week of December. Students now contact the mentors, look through issues to fix or new ideas to implement. The communication and activity of students and mentors is monitored by the program managers and any necessary help is provided by KOSS. Students have to submit their project reports by January 6th, while the successful participation of students depends on the work they do and their mentor's evaluation.",
    "Detailed role descriptions and goals are discussed in the Student's Manual and the Mentor's Manual of the program.",

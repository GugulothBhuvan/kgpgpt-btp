    "KHOJ: The Ultimate Treasure Hunt is the Largest and the most exciting event for Freshers, organized by Azad Hall of Residence, IIT Kharagpur.",
    "The onset of July brings with itself new life to the IIT campus. Blooming with it come the innocent first years, unknowing and curious to explore the beautiful campus. Their wish is fulfilled by the Azad hall of residence by organizing KHOJ, a campus treasure hunt for inspiring the first years to explore the campus with friends as a game and make it one of the most memorable event of their stay in IIT KHARAGPUR. It was started in 2000. KHOJ is the first and the biggest event organized exclusively for the first years. Boys and girls of the campus equally participate in it with full zest and zeal. The students are required to form a group of five, and then the teams are given clues of a place in the campus. They are required to unlock the clues, reach the required place and then find the code hidden somewhere at that place. This is done many times until a team unlocks all the clues and is declared the winner and prizes rain in the event with many teams getting prizes just based on their luck! Though the winner of the event may be one team but the enthusiasm the first years show makes everyone a winner. The event brings with itself joyfulness in the entire campus and gives a first year opportunity to interact with his/her batchmates and the campus. The event continues to grow every year bearing a testimony of the saga of the AZAD HALL OF RESIDENCE.",

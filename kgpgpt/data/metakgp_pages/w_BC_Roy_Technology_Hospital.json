    "On March 21, 2009, an erstwhile 3rd year undergraduate student Rohit Kumar went to the hospital for checkup. It was a Saturday evening and he was complaining of headache. Although there's no record of any report. Next morning, he had to re-visit the hospital because his conditions had gone worse and he was in severe pain. He was then sent back home with some prescribed painkillers. Unfortunately, while going back to his hostel he collapsed and his head hit a cow-trap. He was immediately taken back to the hospital where he waited around 3 hours to get an appointment with a doctor. After his arrival, the doctor without any treatment, referred him to Apollo Hospital, Kolkata stating that he needed a neurologist. He was put in an ambulance with two of his friends and one pharmacist and no trained paramedic. On the way, the conditions got worse and they decided to go for Midnapore Hospital instead. He was declared 'Dead on Arrival' at Medinipur Hospital.",

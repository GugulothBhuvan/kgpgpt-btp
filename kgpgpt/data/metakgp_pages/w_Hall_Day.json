    "Hall Day is an annual event celebrated by each hall of residence on a particular day, typically before the onset of Gymkhana elections . This held so that the election candidates can do room-to-room publicity and learn. On this day, boarders of the hall invite their friends, faculty and other people to visit their room. Also, the restricted entry of boys and girls to each others' halls is temporarily relieved during the event. Many students make their room clean and bring some snacks and cold-drinks for there friends. They put posters on their wall for short message. On this occasion, DJ night and rain-dance is organized in some halls and many small stalls are open for the guests.",

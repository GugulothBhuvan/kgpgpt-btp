    "The Space Technology Students' Society was founded way back in 2008 by a group of students extremely enthusiastic about the frontiers of space technology. It was formed as an official student body under the Kalpana Chawla Space Technology Cell (KCSTC). Since then, the society has grown in size and activities. The idea of a national level space-oriented fest was conceived and thus implemented as the National Students' Space Challenge (NSSC) in the year 2011. NSSC has been successfully organised for twelve more editions since then.",
    "A subgroup of spAts, the FQTQ team which is a dedicated Astronomy discussion group was formed in 2016 under the guidance of Siddhant Singh.",
    "The student body of spAts is divided into two subgroups - the core teams consisting of Design team, Tech team and Management team (which is more concerned with management and outreach) and the FQTQ team (which is more based on Astronomical discussions and applications). spAts organises sky-gazing sessions, space-themed discussions and talks, webinars, lectures, presentations and publishes the bi-semester newsletter, \"the moonwalk\" for the people in the IIT Kharagpur community. The teams also organise the National Students' Space Challenge during the months of September-October.",
    "spAts organises its selections during late August, once per year that is aimed only for the newly joining freshers for a continued membership till the end of the members' tenure. spAts organises an introductory seminar before the selections, where the functioning of the society as well as about NSSC is presented.",
    "The interested candidates join as Junior Coordinators (JCoords) who conduct the NSSC. For the JCoord team, the candidate's technological, management, communication skills etc. are considered.",
    "Later, selections for joining the spAts team happen, where interested candidates select one portfolio from the FQTQ team, Design team, Tech team and Management team where emphasis is given on prior knowledge in the specific portfolio, presentation skills, previous experience with the concerned technologies and knowledge in the fields of Astronomy and Astrophysics. Selections are done in three rounds, an initial interview, a task round and a final interview where the task submissions are reviewed.",
    "spAts is mainly comprised of its two subgroups - the Core teams and the FQTQ team. Each subgroup have their own undertaking tasks but mainly the whole team collectively organises the NSSC fest.",
    "These teams are mainly responsible for Management, Outreach, Communication, Publicity, Sponsor handling, Design, Web Design and Finance for the fest and the other activities spAts organises. The core teams consist of the Design team, the Tech team and the Management team",
    "FQTQ stands for From Quarks to Quasars, which describes the team more oriented to astrophysics in general. They hold periodic discussions and presentations on various topics along with sky-gazing events, open talks, webinars and content development.",
    "Conducting the fest remains a major task for the whole spAts team. The team structure is as follows -",
    "5th and the 4th years comprise the Steering Committee (SCom)",

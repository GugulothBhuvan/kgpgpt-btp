    "Each hall sends a team of 4 people to participate in this event. Questions cover a range of topics like algebra, geometry, number theory and combinatorics. Each team solves the exam together and the judges rank the halls according to their scores at the end of the exam.",
    "A problem statement containing specifications of the software to be developed and related constraints is released to public at the start of the competitions. Each hall then works through their solution over the stipulated even period (x days) to make a submission. Later, each hall presents their solution to a panel of internal and external judges who then award marks and accordingly rank the teams.",

    "1 About us",
    "Technology Environment Society (TES) is a student-led organization at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur. TES is dedicated to the conservation and preservation of the environment, and to promoting sustainability in society. Its members are committed to raising awareness about ecology, nature, and the environment, and to sensitizing others to the importance of protecting our planet. Through a range of initiatives and activities, TES strives towards more sustainable future by finding solutions to environmental challenges and promoting conservation efforts within the campus and the wider community.",
    "2 Vision",
    "TES aims to enhance and preserve the socio-ecological space within the IIT Kharagpur campus, with a focus on sustainability and community welfare.",
    "3 History",
    "3.1 Vision Prabaho",
    "Although TES was officially institutionalized as a part of Gymkhana in 2021, its roots date back to 2018 when it was founded as Vision Prabaho by Biswarup Mondal, Sirsendu Sekhar Barman and Pragnaditya Malakar, who formed a team with other enthusiastic members. Vision Prabaho, the mother organization, is now registered as an NGO run by IIT Kharagpur alumni and other like-minded individuals. Our journey began when we met Mr. Tarak Chandra Paul, an environmentalist with an exceptional passion for green initiatives. We invited him to our IIT Kharagpur campus and organized awareness programs that received an overwhelming response from students, faculty, and campus residents. This enthusiasm motivated us to consider how we could contribute to building a better future. The team then embarked on various projects, campaigns, and initiatives to address environmental issues. We recognized the need to bring all stakeholders together under one umbrella for this common goal. The team was bolstered by the support of Prof. P. P. Chakraborty (Former Director, IIT Kharagpur), Prof. W. Mohanty (Gymkhana president), Prof. P. Patnaik, Late B.B. Rai (Senior Engg Horticulture section), and many other faculty members during our initial phases. Furthermore, the unwavering support from Ms. B. Chakraborty, Ms. A. Patnaik, and other campus residents tremendously helped us shape our idea.",
    "3.2 Incorporation as a Gymkhana society",
    "Finally, TES was formalized as a full-fledged Gymkhana society in November 2021. Since then, it has grown steadily and is perhaps the first student organization in IIT dedicated to environmental issues. TES now has over 30 student members, including undergraduate, postgraduate, and research scholars.",

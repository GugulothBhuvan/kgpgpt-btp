In case you're carrying a card, before you leave the branch, make it absolutely sure that they activate it. In case you've a long transit at any other country, please carry the respective currency as well.",

    "The SBI Multi-Currency Foreign Travel Card is very useful. It is accepted throughout the world and can be used at ATMs in your destination country to withdraw the local currency. This allows you to carry enough currency to last you 2 or more months because you can use ATMs instead of having to carry actual currency.",

    "How much cash is enough cash? Depending on the country, and your arrangements, you may have varying expenses such as transit from airport to your accommodation, rent/safety deposits, daily/monthly transit passes, grocery shopping, etc. Take into account these initial expenses and carry enough cash to sustain until your intern payments. Discount for differences in cost of living between India and the respective country.",
    "Immigration and Work Permit: These procedures should be done when you enter the foreign country. You'll be required to produce the visa documents, and will be issued a work permit if they're fine. Be sure to keep safe any immigration document that you might be issued.",
    "Getting a SIM card: You may want to obtain a SIM card at the city where you will be living. However, most developed countries have WiFi at public places, transit stations, etc. Most often, your work place will have WiFi too.",

So, while opening your account, request the bank to help you get thorough with the particulars.",

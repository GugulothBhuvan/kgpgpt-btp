    "The Counselling Centre was set up in 2009 by the Dean Of Students′ Affairs, IIT Kharagpur as an outcome of his efforts to make the campus a better campus for the entire student community.",
    "It provided the students a place where they could easily approach with a problem and leave with a solution. The reach of the Counselling Centre was further extended through the Hall Coordinators Team. However, the increasing strength of students in the campus called for active participation from the students themselves in this cause. This was the scenario which saw the establishment of the Student Welfare Group in August 2011.",
    "Student Welfare Group was initially an idea that evolved out of a feeling to perpetuate and nurture a campus life which is hassle-free. Today, it is a dedicated group of students willing to sort out various issues of concern for the students. It plans to emerge as a more successful organization with more activities managed and implemented for the welfare of students.",
    "The aim of SWG is to ensure that every student's life in KGP is hassle free so that they can achieve their potential zenith while their stay in KGP as well as in their professional career. SWG aims to instil a belief in every student that they can achieve all their goals in life. SWG assists students in resolving their difficulties in every field, be it academic or extra-academic & curricular or co-curricular. It aims to create and sustain an environment that promotes personal growth and discovery, the pursuit of healthy minds and bodies, and participation in the creation of a caring community.",
    "This programme involves the guidance and mentorship of every single first year student by a 3rd or 4th year student of the same department. The objective of this programme is to help the first years understand the various aspects of college life, and adapt accordingly. This programme ensures that the hindsight of the Mentor becomes the foresight of the Mentee. The Mentees can benefit immensely from the insight of the Mentor and find the best possible way to utilize their time in the campus. The Student Mentor Programme provides scope for constructive and productive interaction between the freshmen and the experienced seniors, which forms an integral part of college life.",
    "An interactive session organized by the SWG for those who feel like they are lagging behind in the course because of no prior knowledge. Programming and Data Structures is an important course of the first year curricula. The instructors are senior students of the institute who try to increase the problem tackling capability of the students, starting from the very basic level and build up their confidence to face the competition. In Friday’s sessions, tutorial sheets are provided to the students and the tutors help them to solve the questions by clearing the doubts of each and every student. In Sunday’s sessions, students are supposed to come with their laptops and they are given a set of programming questions like the ones given in PDS Laboratory classes. The tutors help the students in coding, compiling and running their programs. At the end of the sessions, the instructors also provide printed solution of the tutorial sheet to the students.",
    "Student Welfare Group in association with Smart Training Institute, a renowned organization for grooming and perfecting soft skills , presents an opportunity to boost students' performance at group discussions and personal interviews just as the season for internships and placements begins. The workshop has been a success in the past with most of the students giving positive feedback. Since the collaboration with the private institute is in its early phase, there is a lot of room and scope in future. Taking into consideration the feedback, the SWG aims to provide better workshops in the following sessions.",
    "Student Welfare Group organised a Panel Discussion by the batch of 2010-11. It invited students to open up to the valuable experience shared by the panelists in a discussion encompassing every facet of KGP life, including academics, extracurriculars, sports, societies and PORs. This discussion was very helpful for freshers who had just joined the institute. Panelists shared their vast experience of 4-5 years in KGP. Apart from freshers, a large number of 2nd and 3rd year students also gathered for this panel discussion.",
    "SWG presents ForeSight , a program which provides the campus students a unique interface to connect with the people who have mastered their field and hence get a foresight of their future. It will cover various career related dimensions (placements, internships, FTs, competitions) from the students of the campus as well as alumni of the institute.",
    "A campus ride is being organized to acquaint freshers about the important places of the campus that a student needs to know. It begins from Technology Students' Gymkhana, IIT Kharagpur (TSG). In 2015, more than 1200 freshers in 28 separate buses were shown the magnificence of the KGP campus with engaging interactions of SWG team with freshers.",
    "For the first time in the history of our campus, printed version of Institute Information Brochure was circulated among all the freshers, thanks to the rigorous efforts of the SWG team and support of the administration. We hope it has helped the freshers batch a lot in their initial days here at KGP.",

    "Codex is an initiative by CodeStash, IIT Kharagpur, that was founded for the sole purpose of helping freshers coming to the institute to get started and improve their coding skills. This facebook group, open to the students of IIT Kharagpur, is a platform where students can get their doubts cleared optionally being anonymous and communicate with like-minded people. This group is currently under the guidance of CodeClub (Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering) .",
    "A class was conducted for freshers, in computer programming ahead of ACM ICPC and Robotix Winter Workshop (A requirement for Image processing phase).",
    "An event where freshers with enthusiasm for sport-coding gathered and solved multiple competitive coding problems with their algorithms discussed at the end.",
    "CodeStash helped seven teams (six fresher teams) from IIT Kharagpur to get mentors for their registration into ACM ICPC, which is often considered as the Olympics of programming. This is almost the first time in KGP that freshers (almost twenty of them) appeared for the competition."

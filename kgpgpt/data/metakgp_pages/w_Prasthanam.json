    "The youngest of all dramatics societies, Technology Dramatics Society - Prasthanam has grown in leaps and bounds since being recognized by the Technology Students' Gymkhana in 2013. It is a society formed to assimilate, perpetuate and integrate the rich culture and dramatics heritage of the Telugu speaking people into the mainstream culture of IIT Kharagpur.",
    "Prasthanam's main goal is to encourage, nurture and showcase the various talented individuals, helping them reach their potential and realizing the hopes, dreams and aspirations of the seniors and alumni who have worked really hard to bring Prasthanam to where it is now.",
    "Prasthanam selection auditions are held once per year, only for first years, in August for an active membership for all four/five years. The society selects a batch of 30-40 first years (UG)  at the beginning of the academic year soon after the welcome production. Selection procedure consists of tasks that judge voice modulation, intensity, speech and diction, confidence and acting skills.",
    "Prasthanam has four governors selected by the society seniors every year who govern the society and represent it in the Gymkhana. Overall co-ordination during productions outstations and competitions are handled by the governors.",
    "Within two weeks of the Autumn Semester starting, Prasthanam performs its first production of the year. The cast ranges from second years to Third years. The aim of this Production is to Entertain Freshers from Telugu Community with its Comical Plays. This is also the first time the Governors for the new tenure are introduced to KGP.",
    "The freshers are given a thorough training of theatre oriented workshops that teach them the basics of dramatics. Skills like voice modulation, voice intensity, dramatization, body posture, stage movements, third forms, etc are taught in groups. First years along with the four governors train for three weeks at the Main Building. Occasional skits, monologues and challenging impromptu are attempted to improve the versatility of the actor.",
    "The Governors with the help of the entire society train the first years and with rigorous practice put up a production, with the entire cast being first years and background works are done by second years.",
    "The last act of the year (referred to as the Annual Production) is performed during End-March to Early-April. The Annual Production sees the most diverse crowd play together.",
